Great! Iâ€™ll help you step-by-step to become qualified for this Flutter Software Engineer position. Since you're a beginner, weâ€™ll build a structured learning plan covering all the required skills from the job description, including:

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 1: **Fundamentals of Flutter & Dart (2â€“3 weeks)**

* **Learn Dart Basics**: Data types, functions, OOP (classes, inheritance, mixins).
* **Intro to Flutter**: Widgets (stateless, stateful), layouts, navigation, and theming.
* **Resources**:

  * Dart: [https://dart.dev/codelabs](https://dart.dev/codelabs)
  * Flutter: [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 2: **Building Real Apps & Working with APIs (3â€“4 weeks)**

* Build simple apps like a to-do list, weather app, or notes app.
* Learn:

  * State management (start with `Provider`, later explore `Bloc`).
  * Integration with REST APIs using `http` package.
  * Basic error handling and null safety.

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 3: **Testing, Git, & CI/CD (3â€“4 weeks)**

* **Testing**:
  * Learn how to write unit, widget, and integration tests in Flutter.
  * Practice test coverage tools.
  * 
* **Git & GitLab**:
  * Use Git for version control.
  * Understand GitLab branching (feature branches, merge requests).
    
* **CI/CD** (optional but a plus):
  * Try GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to automate builds and tests.

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 4: **Advanced Concepts (DDD, SOLID, OOP, Agile)**

* **OOP & SOLID Principles**:

  * Deepen understanding through Dart and design patterns.
* **DDD**:

  * Understand basic concepts: entities, value objects, aggregates.
* **Agile**:

  * Learn basics of Scrum: sprints, standups, retrospectives.
